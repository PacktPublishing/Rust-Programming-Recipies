# Note
Since this course was developed. A key crate in these libraries has been deprecated. This is because the Rust standard library incorporated some of it's features into the std::error::Error trait. In order to fit with how most future libraries will use errors it is recommended to switch from using failure to anyhow, and failure_derive to this error.The code included in the project has been updated to fit with this change.

# Rust Programming Receipes[Video]
This is the code repository for [Rust Programming Receipes[Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/programming/rust-programming-recipes-video). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
This video course features application-specific recipes to boost your development of real-world apps by integrating Rust units into your existing applications, even those written in another language. Geared towards those already familiar with the basics of Rust, this course will take you through solutions that will allow you to use Rust code samples right away in your existing applications.

You will learn key techniques that Rust uses to write scalable code, including advanced-level concepts such as error handling, macros, fearless concurrency, and zero cost abstractions such as futures, and create an HTTP server that reads from a database. We'll cover some of the many benefits of working in Rust as you write systems-level software. We'll move on to add our Rust code into existing C and Python applications so that you can learn how to integrate our new fast and safe code into other environments.

By the end of the course, you will have a strong foundational knowledge in server-side programming, enabling you to deliver solutions to build high-performance web applications and services using Rust.
